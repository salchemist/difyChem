However, developing ionogel strain sensors with outstanding mechanical properties (particularly high fatigue resistance), a wide strain detection range, and a linear resistance response remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a facile solvent evaporation-assisted annealing strategy to fabricate strong, anti-fatigue, anisotropic Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) ionogels. Solvent evaporation increases tensile stress during pre-stretching, promoting macromolecular alignment, while annealing optimizes macromolecular conformation, ensuring the maintenance of the anisotropic structure. The resulting anisotropic ionogels exhibit an exceptional fatigue threshold of 3232.87 ± 254.64 J·m-2, along with high tensile strength, toughness, and Young’s modulus of 45.40 ± 4.81 MPa, 30.78 ± 8.32 MJ·m-3, and 77.38 ± 15.07 MPa, respectively. The ionogel strain sensors, with cyclic sensing stability, can detect small strains (as low as 0.2%), provide a linear resistance response (up to 200% strain), and output stable and reliable strain sensing signals even in the presence of cracks in the ionogel. These strong, flaw-insensitive, and multifunctional ionogels are well-suited for stress-bearing materials and advanced wearable electronics.\nKeywords: Anisotropic ionogel, Fatigue resistance, Mechanical properties, strain sensors\nSuggested Citation: Suggested Citation\nWang, Yuqing and Liu, Zhanqi and Liu, Yuntao and Li, Yong and Wang, Ling and Huang, Xuewu and Gao, Jiefeng, Anti-Fatigue Ionogels for High-Performance Strain Sensing.
